# Project Management
Repository for Managing various projects within the XChem group.
The main project board will house a list of projects within the XChem group and project convenient links to the specific repositories and corresponding project boards which should be used for bug and feature requests (and discussion).

## Developer Instructions

1. Create a new repository or have an existing repository that has it's own project board that you would like to add to the main project board.

2. Add the `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` from `AdditionalFiles` folder to the `.github` folder in the root of your git repo.

3. Submit a new project/issue to this repo (follow all the steps in the template). Linking the urls to the git repo, the corresponding project board, assigning people who are working on this project and providing a brief overview of  

## Non-Programmer (Frank's) Instructions

1. Submit a new project/issue using the `Add a brand NEW Project (one that needs creating)` template: 
[Click Here Frank!](https://github.com/xchem/ProjectManagement/issues/new?assignees=&labels=PROJECT+-+NEEDS+INIT&template=add-a-brand-new-project--one-that-needs-creating-.md&title=%5BNEW+PROJECT%5D)

2. Follow the steps, assigning people and giving a highly indepth description of what is required of the project

3. We may have to assimilate the NEW project into other projects, so please consider if this is in fact a new project OR merely a feature request for an existing project then please go to existing project board and follow the issue requests there.

### For us nerds
4. 
- Discuss/clarify the specifications in the issue if needed. Assign members etc.
- Alter the issue accordingly to become a project if it has been initialised.  
- Correctly link the new repo and the project
- Populate the project with some issues (if needed)
4. (Alternative)
- Close, link and archive the old issue into the new issue following the above developer instructions.

## Last Steps:
Go to the [Main Projects kanban](https://github.com/orgs/xchem/projects/1) and move the card to whereever it needs to go in from triage.

## To Do:
- Discuss how we can implement milestones?
